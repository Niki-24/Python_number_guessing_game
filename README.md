# Python_number_guessing_game
📌 Project Overview
The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based Python application where the user tries to guess a secret number within a limited number of attempts.
The program provides hints after each guess and ends when the user either guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.
This project is built using basic Python concepts like loops and conditional statement 
# 🎓 Project Purpose
This project was created to strengthen Python fundamentals and improve logical thinking, especially useful for coding interviews and beginner-level programming practice. 
🚀 Features
User gets limited attempts (3 tries)
**Displays hint messages:**
  - 📈 "Too High"
  - 📉 "Too Low"
- Prevents invalid input (negative numbers not allowed)
- Displays win or lose message
- Simple and beginner-friendly logic

# 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- While Loop
- If-Else Conditional Statements
- User Input Handling

# 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding loop control (while)
- Using conditional statements (if-elif-else)
- Managing counters and attempts
- Implementing basic game logic
- Improving problem-solving skills

# ✨ Future Improvements
- Generate random secret number
- Add difficulty levels (Easy / Medium / Hard)
- Track number of attempts used
- Add score system
- Add replay option
